INTRODUCTION
------------

The Metatag Routes module allows a user to configure metatags for custom
controllers generated by code.

It uses the metatags entity to store a configuration for any route using the
metatags administration.

The module adds a button in the default metatag dashboard page giving the user
the option to enter the route path and validates if the path has a defined
route, the route is not administrative and the route is "meta-taggeable".
