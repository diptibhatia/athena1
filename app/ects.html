                    </div>

                    <p>European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) ECTS is designed to make it easier for
                        students to move between countries and to have their academic qualifications and study periods
                        abroad recognised.</p>

                    <p>The European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) is a tool introduced by the countries
                        in European Higher Education Area in order to make the education system more flexible and
                        transparent. Its makes student life easier when it comes to move between countries and to have
                        their academic qualifications and study periods abroad equalized and recognised.</p>

                    <p>ECTS allows credits taken at one higher education institution to be counted towards a
                        qualification studied for at another. ECTS credits represent learning based on defined learning
                        outcomes and their associated workload. 60 ECTS credits are the equivalent of a full year of
                        study or work. In a standard academic year, these credits are usually broken down into several
                        smaller modules. So a three year Bachelor's Degree carries 180 ECTS and a one year Master Degree
                        carries 60 ECTS credits ECTS enhances the flexibility of study programmes for students. It also
                        supports the planning, delivery and evaluation of higher education programmes. It is a central
                        tool in the Bologna Process, which aims to make national education systems more comparable. The
                        Bologna Process is a mechanism of promoting intergovernmental cooperation between 48 European
                        countries in the field of higher education. ECTS also helps make other documents, such as the
                        Diploma Supplement, clearer and easier to use in different countries. ECTS has been adopted by
                        most of the countries in the European Higher Education Area as the National Credit System and is
                        increasingly used elsewhere.</p>
